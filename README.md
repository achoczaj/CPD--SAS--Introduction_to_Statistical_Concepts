# CPD--SAS--Introduction_to_Statistical_Concepts
Notes and labs from SAS Introduction to Statistical Concepts

This course covers basic statistical concepts that are critical for understanding and using statistical methods. This course explains what statistics is and why it is important to understand the characteristics of your data.
The information in this course is a prerequisite for many other statistical courses SAS Education offers. The course is appropriate for Base SAS and SAS Enterprise Guide users. Data, practices, and a Case Study are included.

### Learn how to
- examining data distributions
- obtaining and interpreting sample statistics using the UNIVARIATE and MEANS procedures
- examining data distributions graphically in the UNIVARIATE and SGPLOT procedures
- constructing confidence intervals
- performing simple tests of hypothesis.
